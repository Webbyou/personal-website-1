# Personal Website

My personal website where I gather a bunch of front end web development thoughts in a blog and I also list some of my past projects.

## Formatting code blocks in markdown

In order to have the code be readable in articles, the code should be ran through the [following prettier playground config](https://prettier.io/playground/#N4Igxg9gdgLgprEAuEIA0IIAcYEtoDOyoAhgE5kQDuACuQkSiQG4S4Am6IARmSWAGs4MAMpZ+uKAHNkMMgFc4GABYwAtgBsA6stzwC4sHBEM9uZnoCeycASIZJBOGRg0+UtSWQAzEhqcYAFYEAB4AQnyCwiIkanAAMpJwPn4BIMEhIpJSGnAAivIQ8Cn+SiDiZE5kNjCWWHAEYGS4OFxYzbBaHDDKyAAcAAwY7RBOWnxYNu0NzszJGACOhfBu2IwgJAQAtFBwcOz7XGRwS7jHbiQeXki+pRhOariyCmUE2bkFRck3qWUwJNwuuwesgAEwYOQkXAabIAYQgak8Nig0HmIHkTgAKgDGLcnABffFAA). This will indent the code with 2 spaces and have a print width of 80 characters. Also a comment of \<!-- prettier-ignore --> will need to be added at the start of the code block to prevent automatic formatting of the code block.
